Description: This stack deploys a Fargate cluster that is in a VPC with both
             public and private subnets. Containers can be deployed into either
             the public subnets or the private subnets, and there are a load
             balancer inside the public subnet, which can be used to
             send traffic to the containers in the private subnet.
